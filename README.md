# Package_DesignerAI

üìù Project Overview
AI Packaging Design Platform is a web-based platform that enables businesses to generate professional, print-ready packaging designs (e.g., soap boxes, labels) using AI. Users can create designs from text prompts, and in future phases, from hand-drawn sketches or reference images.

‚ùì Problem Statement
Small businesses and startups often face high costs and long turnaround times for custom packaging design. This platform democratizes access to high-quality, unique packaging designs by leveraging AI, reducing both cost and time.

‚ú® Features
- Text-prompt input for AI-powered packaging design generation

üîÑ User Workflow
1. Onboarding: User signs up/logs in.
2. Input: The user enters a text prompt (and, in the future, uploads an image/sketch or selects a template).
3. Generation: The AI model generates a packaging design mockup.
4. Review: Users can preview the design, regenerate it, or tweak it.
5. Download: User downloads print-ready files.
6. Dashboard: The User can view/download previous designs.
